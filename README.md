# Introduction

This repository is to save all the files required to run minecraft java server. 

This runs on a low powered system. Probably barely enough to hold this. 


# Dependencies
- ubuntu 20.04
- locally saved backup
- paper minecraft 1.21.4

## locally saved backup

This needs to be made better, but good enough for now.
